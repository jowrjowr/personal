Is it?

Every database of stars I have seen falsifies your numerological prediction of quantized masses.

Your own website contains falsifications of your claim of no 0.7 M_sun peaks.

Every microlensing suervey I have ever seen has falsified your claim of MACHO based dark matter.

What does it say about your numerology when you cannot muster even a single technical argument against my claims? Instead of a technical argument you break out ye olde ad-hominem about how I'm not "professional" or "objective".

Sure they do. All the time.

Ask a scientist about creationism, solid state theory, aether theories, your numerology...

That'd be impressive if we only knew the masses of 17 stars. 

Unfortunately for you, thousands and thousands of stars have masses known to a few percent or better. Why don't you count them? This is what is known as "confirmation bias" in which you only count things that support you.

Besides, your claim of "realistic uncertainties" depends entirely whether the result agrees with your numerology. What are the error bars on your supporting stars, again?

That is not true. I've shown you databases of hundreds and thousands of stars that falsify your numerology. 

They aren't counted.

All of the stars you have cited were published after September of 2011?
All of the stars have an error bar of 0.01 M_sun or better?
All of the stars are dynamically determined without using spectroscopic instrumentation at all?

Are you SURE you want to make that claim? For every star you think supports you, I can find at least fifteen times that at *your* requested precision, much less an equilvalent level.

In exploit development, a "proof of concept" means you have a test case that shows what you claim. What you have is theorycrafting, not a proof of concept.

Where's your proof of concept? Even a trivial examination of the literature has falsified your numerology.

Do you think I'm pulling a fast one on you, Robert?

I've published the data sources used. 
I've published the code used.
I've published the assumptions.

Here are the falsifcations of your numerology again:

People other than myself have done these tests, and falsified your numerology. 

At the end of the day, you are posting to USENET and demanding professional scientists with PhD's and everything do your research for you. Do you realize how ridiculous that is? Why don't you exercise a bit of personal initative and do the analysis yourself?

Wait, didn't the Kepler group publish a survey of the masses of stars via direct measurement? And didn't you ignore those as well? Are you sure you are interested in what anyone, professional or not, thinks?
